## About Me
I am working at Cambridge Consultants, currently as a Director Of Software Development, Wireless & Digital Services division in our Seattle office.

Along with leading a team of incredibly talented software engineers, I am working on software for a wide variety of deeply embedded, resource-constrained connected products for our clients.
My main interests are in secure software, networking stacks, RTOS, systems design, and digital hardware.
